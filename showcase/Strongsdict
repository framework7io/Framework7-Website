Hello

I'm happy to announce that we just finished your complete re-design from the ground up with Framework 7 for Android and iOS devices.

I used different other frameworks but some very important on-the-fly data manipulation required for this App did not work with other solutions. So I gave Framework 7 a try - and as you can see the result is an App for iOS and Android devices with a native look and feel and we are also very happy with the performance. So Framework 7 was the right choice and I have a feeling that we will also migrate many other Apps to Framework 7.
